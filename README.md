Students  compare  and  contrast  a  variety  of  data  structures.  Students  compare 
algorithms for tasks such as searching and sorting, while articulating efficiency in 
terms  of  time  complexity.  Students  implement  data  structures  and  algorithms  to 
support solution designs.

> Compare and contrast a variety of data structures. 
 
> Compare algorithms for their efficiency in terms of time complexity. 

> Implement data structures and algorithms to support solution designs. 

> Examine and compare brute-force vs. divide-and-conquer sorting algorithms. 

> Examine and compare sequential, binary, depth-first and breadth-first search algorithms. 

> Compare and contrast the difference between trees and balanced trees
